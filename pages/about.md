## About the Collection

The Lewis Mss. is a collection of personal correspondences from former New York governor Morgan Lewis and his wife Gertrude Lewis. Written between 1812-1815, the 26 letters detail Lewis’ tenure as Major General during the War of 1812, where he served primarily in upstate New York. These letters are housed in the Lilly Library, and in 2022, I used them as the foundation for my history degree’s capstone project. As part of that project, I transcribed the collection in its entirety. This Z652 Digital Libaries project houses the original letters alongside their transcriptions.

This project is significant because the Lewis Mss. has not previously been transcribed; as younger generations of scholars don't know cursive, these letters are inaccesible to them. This project would open up this colelction to younger American history scholars. At present, there are woefully few personal correspondences digitally available from the War of 1812, so the transcribed collection has a large benefit for researchers who can’t afford to travel the East Coast for research on the Early National Era. 
War of 1812 aside, this CollectionBuilder meshes nicely with other personal correspondence and journal repositories like Alexander Street’s [American Civil War: Letters and Diaries](https://search.alexanderstreet.com/cwld) database, [North American Women’s Letters and Diaries](https://search.alexanderstreet.com/nwld) database, or Adam Matthew’s [Colonial America](https://www.colonialamerica.amdigital.co.uk/) database.
