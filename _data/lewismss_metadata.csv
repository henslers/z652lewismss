“I thank you my dearest love for your affectionate Letter of Monday last, and cannot consent to your being disappointed in its main Object, although I write so many letters herforce[?] and am so much occupied with them, and with a variety of other matters, that I am obliged almost to desert my private Correspondences. Though much harrassed, I enjoy good health and grow fat from it. a pretty good proof that it agrees with me. 
<br>
<br>
I hope our dear daughter’s attack is not the commencement of a furious intermittent and that it will be speedily removed. If I have the oppotunity I will find some Bark. If not I must bring it, and hope it may not be delaied[sic] beyond Monday Evening, tho I cannot speak with certainty. I shall go on the next boat to NYork.
<br>
<br>
Nothing in the shape of a cook is here to be met with. Mrs. Ludlow says they send to New York, for all the cooks they employ here.
<br>

I have just returned from hearing M. Blows[?] preach a sermon on the War, which for elegance of Composition has seldom been surpassed, for piety and patriotism never. He made his [?] Brethren stare and wince. His text was from Job. “Be afraid of the sword + [?].” He considered hear[sic] as the source of Heaven for a Nations Sins. That its infliction on Britain was equally so, as on us. That as Heaven willed it it could not be considered unjust. That it was often the only means of protecting national rights and se????ing fair and lasting peace. That when every effort to avoid it by negotiation had failed, an appeal to arms for ??dress of national earrngs[?] became a duty. That such a war rendered the characters of the Soldier honorable, and that the constituted Authorities having decided on it, it became the duty of every man, be his Sentiments of his politicks what they mays, to give it a vigorous and manly support; and that those who would not defend the Country which gave them birth, or which nurtured them in her bosom, be her Energies whom they may, could neither expect to be accepted of God or of Man. 
<br>
<br>
My pleasure , you may suppose, was heightened, by unexpectedly hearing such sentiments from such a Quarter. I was never more gratified, and could really have pressed him to my bosom.

How think you the business is here rec.d? The feds + Clintonians are mortified at it and cannot conceal their chagrin.

I thank you for your affectionate Letter and I hope although you are not fond of scribbling, you will not forget that immersed as I am in business, charged with the management of every department, from the want of a clue organization of every one but my own, the only pleasure I have is to hear that those whom most I love are at ease and happy. A single Line therefore informing me of the welfare of my family, will always be to me the most grateful and acceptable gift.

We do not yet know the true Causes of Hull’s disaster. Much we have reason to believe is ascribable to disease; as we are informed that as far back as the 29th of last month he had but 800 men fit for duty. I fear however that the head of the War Department will not escape censure. Many of the Federalists cannot disguise their exultation though they pretend to be much mortified. I am happy to find that it has produced no dismay either in the Army, or in the Country at large; on the contrary, it has evidently had the effect of exciting a spirit of Vengeance; and a desire to efface the Pain.

The inclosed will give you the particulars, as far as we possess them, of the imprudent, though gallant Affair at Lewiston. Your friend Solomon, received a wound immediately on landing, through the Thigh. He advanced however with the Troops, received a second through the Hip, he still advanced, received a third through the calf of the oppostie Leg, went on notwithstanding, till[sic] he received a violent contusion in th heel, supposed from a Cannon shot, which brought him to the Ground, and disabled him. He was carried off, and thus saved from being a Prisoner. He is however doing well, as you may believe when I tell you he has sent for a new pair of Boots.

Henry Armstrong, Colo.l.s Christie and Fenwick are slightly wounded and prisoners. Colo.l.s. Stranaghan + Bloom of the militia are also wounded, (the former severely) and are prisoners. Cap.n.s Gibson of the eight Artillery, Neilson of the 6th Infantry, and Lieu.t Morris of the light Artillery (brother of the first Lieu.t who was wounded on board the Constitution) were killed. Our Loss is not ascertained, but believed to be about 400.

The works on the heights of Queenstown were taken by Apault[?]; retaken by the British, again apaulted and carried by our Troops, and the possession maintained for near three Hours; when they marched out and gave Battle to Brock on the plain at the head of five times their members. Thus you see, we have acquired Glory though at a dear rate. The British have asked a three day suspension of Hostilities; which has been granted. Genl. Van Rensselaer[?], in consequences of the height of party Spirit in his Camp, has asked leave to retire.

My dearest friend,
<br>
<br>
Our Army crossed the British lines on Thursday last, at least a considerable Detachment of them, the remainder lying on their arms ready to act according to circumstances. They drove in the Enemy’s advanced Picket Guard and burnt their guard House. Few lives were lost, on our part 6 wounded, one of whon died- the Enemy lost about an equal number killed. Their whole body immediately retreated, destroying the Country as they went- burning their Mills of every description, forage, Barns, and in some instances the dwellings of those of their subjects whom they suspected of disaffection finding they were not displaced to fight us, and knowing we could not follow them to the other side of the S. Lawrence our tropps returned, and are now going into winter quarters. Gen. Dearborn is expected here tomorrow, when I shall be enabled to determine whether it will be necessary for me to remain longer in this Quarter or not. I rather think I shall return with him. I have been perfectly well.

I arrived here, my dearest friend, yesterday to dinner, in company with Gen. Dearborn and Suite. I need not say, how much I was disappointed, on entering M. Ludlow’s house, to find you had departed. The cause was an afflicting one; and produced sensations which, the exertion of all my philosophy could not bear me up against- I was completely unmanned; and do not believe I could at that moment have looked a british army in the face. I found two Letters from you, dated at Clermont, which allayed the pleasure I desired from hearing you were in health, by presenting to my mind the eloquent Ejaculations of the Psalm ist[?] “Lord what is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him.” What a change! Who, who could command his fate, would not sufer[sic] a glorious death in his country’s Cause? 
<br>
<br>
I wrote you twice from Burlington and directed my Letters to the care of M. Ludlow, but understand from him that they were not not[Lewis added the extra “not” as he flipped the page over] sent to him- I presume therefore that the Post Master forwarded them to you____

I arrived here my dear and affectionate friend yesterday about noon, and should have immediately advised you of it, could I have procured a place where I could seat myself to write. The quarters which had been intended for me were occupied as a hospital for the wounded and the late Action; and of course required cleaning before I could enter them. I am now in them, but by no means as comfortably situated as at Niagara. though this place has, in one respect, and important advantage over the other. The Camp is better supplied with small meats from the Country- of course we live better here than there.

The British a few nights since conceived and partly executed a plan for surprising our Ships in the Night. The dispositions making indicated that we had discovered their their Designs, and some of their good friends immediately gave them intelligence to that effect when they hastily retreated from the position they had taken within three or four miles of us. Had the attempt been made they certainly would have paid the Piper.

My dear Love,
<br>
<br>
I have rec.d your kind Letter of the 16th and rejoice to hear you are all well and happy. It is true this place is sickly; owing in a great measure to its extreme filthiness and the uncmmon wetness and coldness of the Season- I have at no time found flannel uncomfortable. I think we have a prospect of the health of the Camp improving- the Season has become more dry, and we have cleansed the augean Stables.
<br>
<br>
The Questions you say are put to you (not I suspect by military Men) you may answer thus. To the first “Why we did not pursue the Enemy that day we landed”- the answer is Obvious- It was impossible. The Enemy previous to his retreating, sent off his whole Train of field Artillery. The works on Queenston Heights were still in his possession and not to be assailed without Artillery, which we could not employ all our Artillery ?orces being the other side the River, and no means of crossing them. Our men throughout the Action had drawn the prices[?] by hand, and were so fatigued, that when a man got on the ground, it was impossible to get him up again. The Army had been on electy[?] since one in the morning, without halting or eating, and our provisions, like our Horses, were on the opposite side of the River. To have pursued an Enemy, through a wasted Country, without provisions, without Ammunition and without Horses and with an already famished Army would have been madness, would have been criminal in the highest degree, and probably would have thrown half of it into the [illegible]. As it was, many fiehened[?] from fatigue and exposure_____
<br>
<br>
The 2nd question, “why we did not continue the pursuit the 2.d day” is one which Gen. Dearborn must answer, I cannot. He ordered me to return when my 
<br>

I receive the Albany Papers now pretty regularly. I have rec.d my [illegible] and Table Cloths. Now come on the Merinos Factory.

Your last letter of the 18th came to me Safely and expeditiously; as probably will all those you may hereafter write, as I have established a daily express mail between this + Utica which goes through in ten hours. 
<br>
<br>
I have been a little indisposed, from the predisposition you know my bowels have to the species of complaint which has been very prevalent here; but which is now becoming milder among the Troops. It has never confined me, and I am at present perfectly well. From the attention I have paid to the cleanliness of the Camp, I am in hopes we shall not have many more new cases of that dreadful Scourge of new Armies.

Robert + John Tillerson[?] went in the Lady of the Lake, to Niagara. John was taken ill of a fever the Second day after leaving this; and returned quite Sick- we have nursed him carefully and had two excellent Physicians attend him- His fever has left him, and he is regaining his appetite, and I have no doubt, in a few days, will be as well as ever. Robert is well and up to his ears in business~

Dearborn is very angry with me for my letter to Armstrong- because I spoke of his Indisposition, and Chandler’s bad position of his Camp. I have assured him I intended him no Injury, + that I only spoke of that everybody knew; and that as to his friend, I gave an Opinion I was prepared to defend. I find he is not to be appeased, and so I shall leave him to his reflections.

My dearest friend,
<br>
<br>
We are all lying here on our Oars watching the arrival of the Secretary of War when it is presumed we shall know what is to be the future Course of the Campaign. Our fleet had been out now for nineteen days. It went up to the head of the Lake where it remains cruising. At York it landed a party and destroyed some public stores. The Lady of the Lake arrived here yesterday morning from the fleet and departed again in the vening with a reinforcement of mariens and Seamen. The Cap.t informed us that yesterday our Army attempted a general Attack on the Enemy, and that many of our Savages had joined us, and would be in the action. The British fleet put to Sea a few days after our’s,[sic] cruised about at this End of the Lake for Some days and went into port again without going in quest of Chaundry notwithstanding they mount nineteen Guns more than he does and of heavier metal. Our advantage is in having long Guns and braver men; and I think if they dare fight they will be beaten. 
<br>
<br>
Our health here is improving; owing to the introduction of a strict police, which has removed the filth, (which certainly caused the sickness,) and prevented the further accumulation of it. You can form no conception of the abominable nuisance which everywhere assailed us on my first arrival. It was difficult to breath[sic], and you could literally taste the putridity of the Atmosphere; had the weather been warm pestilence would have been inevitable. We have now a pure Atmosphere; have taught our men to be cleanly, and have few, if any new Cases of Disease.
<br>
<br>
I have procured some flannel + will make my shirts answe for the present. 
<br>
<br>
Remember me most affectionately to our dear Children. Kiss them for me again + again- God be with you all

Your Aff.

I arrived here my dearest friend yesterday at noon having experienced no other Accident than breaking the Axlehee[? Axwheel?] of my waggon[sic] which delayed my Journey half a day. I was favored with the most delightful weather; neither too hot nor too cold. The roads in as good Order as new roads can be expected to be, free from dust and mud. The only exception to the weather was half an hour’s rain yesterday morning. I am in perfect health and find every Body pleased with my return.

Wilkinson has been ill at Fort George but has recovered. Our Army here is in good health and fine Spirits, and I think if led ag. the Enemy will give a good account of them. God bless you my dearest Life and grant us once more a happy meeting.

48 hours will probaby complete my sojournment at this place. Wilkinson is on the way with the bulk of the Army of Fort George- As soon as he reaches us we shall be off to seek the foe in the Regions of the North.

Sir George has become very civil since Perry’s glorious victory.

Contrary to our wishes and Expectations here we are still, delayed by the most unrelenting Storm I ever witnessed. A few miles back of us, we are told, the Snow is 14 inches deep; though I presume we must allow a little for exageration[sic]. Our Troops who left Fort George the 27th of Sep. have not yet arrived, though the distance is frequently run in 30 hours and has been performed in 14. This is a great drawback on our Operations, and I fear will curtail them to the great dissatisfaction of the Country, who look for naught but Success, and expect their Armies + Navies must control even the Elements.
<br>
<br>
Wilkinson is very unwell, and has been so for a long time. I thank God I am in perfect health though I have been a little annoyed by bile till I got rid of it. I have rec.d your Letters of the 27th [????] + 3.d Ins.t Why is it that when you write to me you never say anything of the state of Things at home which you must suppose I should like to know something of. The State of the Buildings, Farm factory, mills +c. though of the latter I presume you know not much. Give me what little nowledge you have, for a little is better than none.

My dear Child,
<br>
<br>
I was yesterday made happy by the receipt of your Letter of the 6th Ins. The Account you give of Julia is melancholy and interesting; and the shock her disposition must give her father will be a severe one. So fair a flower cut down in the prime of life, is a subject not to be contemplated but with feelings of anguish. All we can say is heaven knows what is for the best, and only acts for the wisest purposes. We must bow submissive to its will. 
<br>
<br>
We should have been off long since from this place had not the fates been adverse. We have been delayed near a Month beyond our calculation by unforseen events. Genl. Wilkinson who went to Fort George to bring the Troops from thence was long confined there by severe indisposition, which has again assailed him at this place. The Troops left Fort George the 28th of last month, and have been encountered by such dreadful Tempests that the whole have not yet arrived. Our embarkation from this day (on which I enter my 60th year) and by tomorrow Evening we shall all be afloat. The fleet has gone out to clear the way for us. Our Objects were first Kingston, next Montreal. The first I fear we shall be obliged to relinquish on Account of the advanced state of the season, for we have have[added an extra time] already had upwards of two feet of Snow in our neighbourhood. The last I think will be an easy conquest. Though our final decision will be made when we reach our place of rendesvous[sic], which is Grenadier Island near the head of the 1st Lawrence. The Enemy has broke up from Fort George and about 1200 of his Troops have arrived at Kingston which will oblige us, if we attempt that place, to make regular approaches, for which I think we have not time;and to attempt it now by assault, would cost more than it is worth. 
<br>
<br>
God bless and preserve you and yours. Remember me most affectionately to your mother, and should Providence in its dispensations decree us to meet no more in this Life, I have the firmest confidence that yours will be devoted to rendering the remnant of her days as tranquil as every affectionate attention on your part can make it. My Will which is in the Iron Chest may be destroyed. I have placed one in the hands of Chief Justice Kent, with the dispositions it makes of my Estate I hope you will all be satisfied.

I arrived at this point on Thursday. Misfortunes still persecute us. The troops embarked from the Harbor on Saturday preceeding- the distance only 18 Miles, and that too along shore; a Storm which arose in the share of five Minutes, without previous notice, dispersed them and wrecked them in all possible situations. They have suffered much and are not-yet-all collected. God knows when we shall set out from here. If we do not in a few days, we may as well abandon our expedition, for the winter will in a few days set in here.

<br>
<br>
I snatch a hasty moment to acknowledge to you all the receipt of the following Letters. Margaret’s of the 10th Ult.[?] with a postscript by Maturin- yours of the 20th and 24th the latter with a postscript by Margaret- Margaret’s of the same date with a postscript by Maturin. These were all handed to me this day.
<br>
<br>
After many delays and losses by incessant Storms, we have at length succeeded in getting the whole of our Army, except the rear guard, safely into the 1st[?] Lawrence. Wilkinson and myself with rear guard join them tomorrow weather permitting. He is very feeble, but will go with us. Our Army is still a fine one, though it has had to encounter innumerable hardships and privations; and when untied to Hamsstort[?], will be sufficient in my Opinion to plant our Standards even on the walls of Quebec were the Season not too far advanced. 
<br>
<br>
Our Enemy is still distracted as to our object. We shall remove this[sic] doubsts in a few days. The prospect before us in an animating one, and with the divine blessing we have an almost certainty of success. Consternation pervades the Enemy’s ranks- He finds he has to contend with a fae, his Superior in bravery, his equal in almost every other requisite of ar?owier[?]. I should not be surprised, should after a feeble resistance, retire to Quebec. In this militia he has lost confidence, and all those who were employed at Prescot have been discharged. I hope soon to write you from Montreal. Keep up your spirits; hope for the best; heaven will not suffer a righteous cause to be defeated. Remember also that lowness of spirits will strengthen the disorder with which you are attacked; and look forward to the happy period when you may hope to bring to my Arms a Wife healthy and happy. I do not believe we have much to apprehend beyond a few hard ships.

At this place, which is situated at the North Boundary of our state, and about six Miles from the St. Lawrence River, terminates, my dearest friend and affectionate wife our northern Campaign for this year. The causes will doubtless be given the public in due time. An important one is that Gen.l Hampton declined inviting his forces to ours though ordered so to do by Genl. Wilkinson and the  Secretary at War. The prefered returning to Lake Champlain and thus deprived us of a large portion of our force. We found the Enemy much stronger than we expected. We had with him a few partial affairs previous to the 9th. On that day Brown was sent forward to attack a force which lay about 20 Miles in our front; consisting of 600 Men. On the 10th he beat them, burnt the Block house and captured Gov.d to Amo.t[meaning Amount] as is said, of, 30,000. On that Evening the Enemy made a shew in our rear and reitred whenever we advanced upon him. On the 11th he commenced on us a brisk Cannonade which he kept up at Intervals from three field pieces and a number of Gun Boats, concealed behind a point. As he did us no Injury we supposed he merely intended to retard our movements and we paid no Attention to him. At three, Orders were given for our Embarkation in 20 Minutes, Wilkinson and my self were both sick in bed in our respective Boats, unable to move. Before the 20 Minutes we were surprised by a smart firing of Musquetry. Boyd instead of embarking had just cut Swartwout’s Brigade to give them Battle. Covington marched to support Swartwout and Boyd to support the whole. A general Action took place, the Enemy being as is said and believed 2500 strong. While our Troops maintained this Order, they three times charged and drove the Enemy from their position behind fences. The impetuosity of Boyd, it is said, (but you must not say it) threw our Line into disorder, broke their ranks, and the Enemy drove us in turn. Covington’s Ammunition was exhausted, and our Artillery just arrived in the field, as our Troops gave way. We retired to our first position and found the Enemy did not choose to try us again, though his force was at least equal if not superior to ours, as we had sent off many detachments. Our Loss is heavy; we have not as yet the whole of the returns but I think it will not fall far short of 400. General Covington and several other Officers fell glorious by. He was a very gallant Soldier__
<br>
<br>
I have never in my life suffered as much as I have done on this expedition. When on shore, lying under Canvass[sic] in cold and boisterous weather equal to January on the Hudson_ When on board, confined to a hole three feet high, with a Constant Dissentary[sic] which set blackberry Jelly and  every other remedy at defiance. I several times thought I should bid adieu to you all without the aid of the Enemy. I am now, thank God on shore, and in a house, though not a comfortable one.  I am far from well, though mending and in hopes of being reestablished shortly by the Aid of a milk + vegetable diet. Wilkinsons prospects I think are not as good, he is completely broke down. I hope Armstrong will order me to Washington to settle my Accounts which will give me an Opportunity of once more embracing you all. Till then + forever God preserve you all prays

You must not my dear Gitty imagine yourself neglected, if you do not receive Letters from me as frequently as you wish.

The reports respecting Wilkinson are various_ I do not believe he has been arrested, but I presume he either has been, or will be removed from the command of the Army. Perhaps much in the same manner that Dearborn was.

My dear Gitty,
<br>
<br>
I have sent by Rob. Livingston’s Sloop, which goes to Delantillon’s[?] Landing, two Barrels of Pork and one of fine mess Beef which you will desire Maturin to send for and distribute between our family and the factory. I have also sent two empty new Barrels to be filled, the one with madeira from the pipe on tap in the Cellar, the other with Greek Wine for our City establishment, which will commence as soon as your Ladyship will honor me with your Company. I have engaged a Cook, a neat looking Irish Girl highly reccomended; brought up in the family of General Gray. I have also partly engaged Mrs. Kennedy who is a very decent and respectable Swiss Catholic who has seen better days. She has a written recommendation from Mrs Armstrong, but cannot do hard work; is a good seamstress and I think will make a good housekeeper, though perhaps it might be well to send to Mrs Armstrong to learn something more of her. She has had charge of the house ever since it was built. In addition to these, you will want a woman to wash, Iron, and scrub and an additional Waiter. Belinda and Mary will answer if they can be spared from home. The house I have ordered to be cleaned. The first floor is occupied as Offices. The second consists of a dining + drawing room completely furnished, and a Bedroom without furniture. The third story is unfurnished Bedrooms. Dearborns Kitchen furniture is in the house and at my service at 25p below the first Cost. You may have it or not. There are also Tubs and Pails of which you will recollect we have many still at Landon’s Farm. 
<br>
<br>
You must send down Bed and Beddings + Bedsheads[sic] if you have them them to spare. I should like the Provost Matrass[sic]. We should also be in a situation occasionally to lodge a friend. By way of aiding you, I will give the following Memorandum of what we shall want from home in addition to the above.
<br>
<br>
Table Cloths. Knives + Forks, Salts, Salvers[?], Spoons, Ladles. Bread Basket. Cartons. SIlver Pitcher, or both, is Marg. can spare hers. Little silver Coffee Pot + Mug and whatever else you can think of. Bring from your Cloaths[sic] Press 2 brass locks and Keys_ + from my Bureau, my Cincinnati medal and the breakfast Knives + forks which are in a leather Bag, in one of the Pidgeon Holes. 
<br>
<br>
You had better send Tobias by Land with your Carriage + come yourself in the steamboat. If the Leaders can travel he may as well bring them also here for sale, unless Maturin wishes to use them. By the way, some arrangemnt must be made to furnish them with a Carriage + horses_ Perhaps the farm Horses may answer till I can match the gray.
<br>
<br>
I called at Bansel’s to endeavor to get a place at his School for Mortimer. He is full and has 20 Applicants on his List. If Margaret would part with Julia, she would be a companion for you, and perhaps it might an advantage to her. Make with our dear Daughter whatever dispositions + arrangments you mututally think best for the satisfaction + happiness of all + each, and I shall be pleased.

Lynih has written to his wife from almost every Stage, ad as he has communicated every thing related to my Affairs I presume you have not wanted information. He is an excellent young man, and must be admired by all who know his worth__ I have born the fatigue of our Journey beyond asperation[?], and reached this City yesterday at noon without Accident or Indisposition. I have this day had a long Interview with the Prest: I rec.d strong professions of personal regard, but informed that the successes of our younger Generals had produced on the public Sentiments, as the Pres. believed, a biass[sic] in favor of employing none else, not to be resisted, though not subscribed to by the Administration. In fine I was referred to Munroe[sic], and shall wait on him tomorrow. I have taken high ground and shall not quit it.

Your’s most affectionately

We commenced on the 31st with the examination of general swarthwout with whom we have been engaged for 3 days and are still apparently far from a close.

The weather has been with us as intensely cold as with you. Everything in my bedroom froze, and I have been obliged to wrap my head in my flannel gown to preserve my nose and ears for a similar fate. I am however in every other respect comfortably situated it's comfortably situated in an amiable and respectable family of good republicans, where cleanliness, good humor, More gentility than is usual in a country village, the village, and the most accommodating disposition prevails. I have been truly fortunate. I am glad to hear you have returned to your old room; it is a more comfortable einter bedchamber than the other.

Tell Casar to take advantage of this snow to break the mare mules. He must be cautious not to overload them, and to place a horse by the side of each in the 1st instance.

I fear for the fate of N. Orleans. We were 3 days ago amused with a story of our complete success - since which are accounts are rather unfavorable. They're unfavorable. God grant success to our Arms in that quarter and Glory and Safety to your Brother and Nephew.

My dearest friend,
<br>
<br>
How has it happened that near a week has elapsed since the wait since the receipt of the news of that change in our foreign relations, which will once more restore me to the bosom of my family, without my receiving A-line from you on the event? Is it that you doubt it's effect on our internal affairs? To mark I confess for myself I have some doubts on this subject; Much will depend on the use we make of it.. Had it not been for our divisions I should have had no objection to the Continuance of war until we had humbled the pride of our haughty antagonist dantagonist - which I think we should have been able to have done; having already convinced the nation's of Europe that England is invincible neither by sea nor land. The dissatisfaction of the British ministerial Prince with the terms of the treaty is a favorable symptom symptom that we shall not find fault with them. I fancy they will change their tone, when they hear of the complete discomfiture of their best troops at New Orleans. It was a glorious finale to the war, and will exult the administration - the effects on our manufacturers I apprehend I apprehend will be foet[?] sensibly_
<br>

You hint at an invitation to you to come and see me - nothing would give me greater pleasure was my situation such as to accommodate you.. But the only passage to my bedroom is through 2 others occupied by gentlemen.

I have burie[?] met Henry Armstrong in Albany, and the Cul  Would scarcely dain me a nod and return to my salutation. What is the cause question MA? Surely his father could not expect I would testify falsely to gratify his resentments. As to all matters of fact my testimony has been corroborated by every witness On the part of the prosecution not one of whom has answered the expectations of the prosecutor. We are getting along rapidly with the trial, and I believe Wilkinson will enter on his defense on Monday next.

I was on Tuesday last at a grand entertainment aint at fudge masters masters, about 14 miles from hence, given to the officers of the army. It consisted of 60 gentlemen and 40 ladies; who dined with him;  And were entertained with a ball in the evening. All en handsome style - a great part of the company stayed to break to breakfast the next morning. I have seldom been at such a pleasant party the women were mostly very handsome, and danced as well as the ladies of any of our Cities. I could scarcely believe my eyes.

My dear Gitty

<br>
The Court martial has adjourned to the 13th_ The badness of the roads has deterred me from taking advantage of the reccess to pay a visit to Staatsburg. The Ice at this place broke up last night and th Boats are plying across this morning- I presume the Steam boats will be in operation in a few days- I have however determined not to quit until we have finished our business_ Tobias neglected telling me where he left the Store room key_ I long to hear how you got home. I fear you have had difficulty.

My love to the Children.

your ever affectionate
