“I thank you my dearest love for your affectionate Letter of Monday last, and cannot consent to your being disappointed in its main Object, although I write so many letters herforce[?] and am so much occupied with them, and with a variety of other matters, that I am obliged almost to desert my private Correspondences. Though much harrassed, I enjoy good health and grow fat from it. a pretty good proof that it agrees with me. 
<br>
<br>
I hope our dear daughter’s attack is not the commencement of a furious intermittent and that it will be speedily removed. If I have the oppotunity I will find some Bark. If not I must bring it, and hope it may not be delaied[sic] beyond Monday Evening, tho I cannot speak with certainty. I shall go on the next boat to NYork.
<br>
<br>
Nothing in the shape of a cook is here to be met with. Mrs. Ludlow says they send to New York, for all the cooks they employ here.
<br>
<br>
I have just returned from hearing M. Blows[?] preach a sermon on the War, which for elegance of Composition has seldom been surpassed, for piety and patriotism never. He made his [?] Brethren stare and wince. His text was from Job. “Be afraid of the sword + [?].” He considered hear[sic] as the source of Heaven for a Nations Sins. That its infliction on Britain was equally so, as on us. That as Heaven willed it it could not be considered unjust. That it was often the only means of protecting national rights and se????ing fair and lasting peace. That when every effort to avoid it by negotiation had failed, an appeal to arms for ??dress of national earrngs[?] became a duty. That such a war rendered the characters of the Soldier honorable, and that the constituted Authorities having decided on it, it became the duty of every man, be his Sentiments of his politicks what they mays, to give it a vigorous and manly support; and that those who would not defend the Country which gave them birth, or which nurtured them in her bosom, be her Energies whom they may, could neither expect to be accepted of God or of Man. 
<br>
<br>
My pleasure , you may suppose, was heightened, by unexpectedly hearing such sentiments from such a Quarter. I was never more gratified, and could really have pressed him to my bosom. 
<br>

I suspect our little Man at Hyde Park has been an euntraine[?].

Genl. Provost sent last week his Adj. General to Genl. Dearborn, with an official Account of the qualified repeal of the British Orders in Council, accompanied with a proposition for our Armistice, which has been acceeded to ‘till the pleasure of the President be known.

How think you the business is here rec.d? The feds + Clintonians are mortified at it and cannot conceal their chagrin. But what most surprises me is, that they now declare they are opposed to every thing like an accomodation on the subject of Seamen and declare that the Eastern States cannot carry on their Commerce without the Aid of British Seamen.

<br>
I thank you for your affectionate Letter and I hope although you are not fond of scribbling, you will not forget that immersed as I am in business, charged with the management of every department, from the want of a clue organization of every one but my own, the only pleasure I have is to hear that those whom most I love are at ease and happy. A single Line therefore informing me of the welfare of my family, will always be to me the most grateful and acceptable gift.

We do not yet know the true Causes of Hull’s disaster. Much we have reason to believe is ascribable to disease; as we are informed that as far back as the 29th of last month he had but 800 men fit for duty. I fear however that the head of the War Department will not escape censure. Many of the Federalists cannot disguise their exultation though they pretend to be much mortified. I am happy to find that it has produced no dismay either in the Army, or in the Country at large; on the contrary, it has evidently had the effect of exciting a spirit of Vengeance; and a desire to efface the Pain.

The inclosed will give you the particulars, as far as we possess them, of the imprudent, though gallant Affair at Lewiston. Your friend Solomon, received a wound immediately on landing, through the Thigh. He advanced however with the Troops, received a second through the Hip, he still advanced, received a third through the calf of the oppostie Leg, went on notwithstanding, till[sic] he received a violent contusion in th heel, supposed from a Cannon shot, which brought him to the Ground, and disabled him. He was carried off, and thus saved from being a Prisoner. He is however doing well, as you may believe when I tell you he has sent for a new pair of Boots.
<br>
<br>
Henry Armstrong, Colo.l.s Christie and Fenwick are slightly wounded and prisoners. Colo.l.s. Stranaghan + Bloom of the militia are also wounded, (the former severely) and are prisoners. Cap.n.s Gibson of the eight Artillery, Neilson of the 6th Infantry, and Lieu.t Morris of the light Artillery (brother of the first Lieu.t who was wounded on board the Constitution) were killed. Our Loss is not ascertained, but believed to be about 400.

<br>
The works on the heights of Queenstown were taken by Apault[?]; retaken by the British, again apaulted and carried by our Troops, and the possession maintained for near three Hours; when they marched out and gave Battle to Brock on the plain at the head of five times their members. Thus you see, we have acquired Glory though at a dear rate. The British have asked a three day suspension of Hostilities; which has been granted. Genl. Van Rensselaer[?], in consequences of the height of party Spirit in his Camp, has asked leave to retire.

My dearest friend,
<br>
<br>
Our Army crossed the British lines on Thursday last, at least a considerable Detachment of them, the remainder lying on their arms ready to act according to circumstances. They drove in the Enemy’s advanced Picket Guard and burnt their guard House. Few lives were lost, on our part 6 wounded, one of whon died- the Enemy lost about an equal number killed. Their whole body immediately retreated, destroying the Country as they went- burning their Mills of every description, forage, Barns, and in some instances the dwellings of those of their subjects whom they suspected of disaffection finding they were not displaced to fight us, and knowing we could not follow them to the other side of the S. Lawrence our tropps returned, and are now going into winter quarters. Gen. Dearborn is expected here tomorrow, when I shall be enabled to determine whether it will be necessary for me to remain longer in this Quarter or not. I rather think I shall return with him. I have been perfectly well.

I have been detained here my dearest friend much longer than I expected or than either of us wishes. But the unexpected arrangment of the Troops for winter quarters and the security of the publis shores, rendered it necessary for me to remain until I could have every thing properly disposed of.

I arrived here, my dearest friend, yesterday to dinner, in company with Gen. Dearborn and Suite. I need not say, how much I was disappointed, on entering M. Ludlow’s house, to find you had departed. The cause was an afflicting one; and produced sensations which, the exertion of all my philosophy could not bear me up against- I was completely unmanned; and do not believe I could at that moment have looked a british army in the face. I found two Letters from you, dated at Clermont, which allayed the pleasure I desired from hearing you were in health, by presenting to my mind the eloquent Ejaculations of the Psalm ist[?] “Lord what is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him.” What a change! Who, who could command his fate, would not sufer[sic] a glorious death in his country’s Cause? 
<br>
<br>
I wrote you twice from Burlington and directed my Letters to the care of M. Ludlow, but understand from him that they were not not[Lewis added the extra “not” as he flipped the page over] sent to him- I presume therefore that the Post Master forwarded them to you____
<br>
<br>
My Absense from this peace has produced an accumulation of buyings which will require some days to get through with. As soon as I can dispose of it, I shall endeavor to obtain leave to join you, for a little time at Staatsberg[?]- God bless you and our house, most fervently prays
