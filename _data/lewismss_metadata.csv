“I thank you my dearest love for your affectionate Letter of Monday last, and cannot consent to your being disappointed in its main Object, although I write so many letters herforce[?] and am so much occupied with them, and with a variety of other matters, that I am obliged almost to desert my private Correspondences. Though much harrassed, I enjoy good health and grow fat from it. a pretty good proof that it agrees with me.  

I hope our dear daughter’s attack is not the commencement of a furious intermittent and that it will be speedily removed. If I have the oppotunity I will find some Bark. If not I must bring it, and hope it may not be delaied[sic] beyond Monday Evening, tho I cannot speak with certainty. I shall go on the next boat to NYork.  

Nothing in the shape of a cook is here to be met with. Mrs. Ludlow says they send to New York, for all the cooks they employ here.  

I have just returned from hearing M. Blows[?] preach a sermon on the War, which for elegance of Composition has seldom been surpassed, for piety and patriotism never. He made his [?] Brethren stare and wince. His text was from Job. “Be afraid of the sword + [?].” He considered hear[sic] as the source of Heaven for a Nations Sins. That its infliction on Britain was equally so, as on us. That as Heaven willed it it could not be considered unjust. That it was often the only means of protecting national rights and se????ing fair and lasting peace. That when every effort to avoid it by negotiation had failed, an appeal to arms for ??dress of national earrngs[?] became a duty. That such a war rendered the characters of the Soldier honorable, and that the constituted Authorities having decided on it, it became the duty of every man, be his Sentiments of his politicks what they mays, to give it a vigorous and manly support; and that those who would not defend the Country which gave them birth, or which nurtured them in her bosom, be her Energies whom they may, could neither expect to be accepted of God or of Man.  

My pleasure , you may suppose, was heightened, by unexpectedly hearing such sentiments from such a Quarter. I was never more gratified, and could really have pressed him to my bosom.  

I suspect our little Man at Hyde Park has been an euntraine[?].  

God bless you. My love to all, ML  

Maur[?] the kitchen Chimney burnt the first rain.

I arrived here my dearest friend at six this morning, after passing, contrary to my expectation, an agreeable night. The Cap.t gave me M. Cutting’s Birth, which was the best in the Cabin, at least the one I like best.  

Genl. Provost sent last week his Adj. General to Genl. Dearborn, with an official Account of the qualified repeal of the British Orders in Council, accompanied with a proposition for our Armistice, which has been acceeded to ‘till the pleasure of the President be known.  

How think you the business is here rec.d? The feds + Clintonians are mortified at it and cannot conceal their chagrin. But what most surprises me is, that they now declare they are opposed to every thing like an accomodation on the subject of Seamen and declare that the Eastern States cannot carry on their Commerce without the Aid of British Seamen.  

___ My best respects to all our friends at Mrs. Clermont. I sincerely wish I was with you.

My dear Love  

I thank you for your affectionate Letter and I hope although you are not fond of scribbling, you will not forget that immersed as I am in business, charged with the management of every department, from the want of a clue organization of every one but my own, the only pleasure I have is to hear that those whom most I love are at ease and happy. A single Line therefore informing me of the welfare of my family, will always be to me the most grateful and acceptable gift.  

We do not yet know the true Causes of Hull’s disaster. Much we have reason to believe is ascribable to disease; as we are informed that as far back as the 29th of last month he had but 800 men fit for duty. I fear however that the head of the War Department will not escape censure. Many of the Federalists cannot disguise their exultation though they pretend to be much mortified. I am happy to find that it has produced no dismay either in the Army, or in the Country at large; on the contrary, it has evidently had the effect of exciting a spirit of Vengeance; and a desire to efface the Pain.  

Has Maturin got the steel reeds? If so, let him start the large Loom for fine flannels. John is manufacturing nothing else, but fine + coarse goods of that description.   

Let my flannel drawers and woolen Stockings be just in order, I shall soon want them.  

Let Smith have his ten dollars, and discharge the Ditchers as soon as you can.  

I send you twenty dollars, all I can at present spare.  

Kiss all our dear Children for me, and give them my blessing.  

I cannot say when I shall be with you It will be some time first.  

your affectionate
