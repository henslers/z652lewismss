Albany 11th Octo. 1812

My dear Love

I gave your Invitiation to the General and Suite which they accept provided nothing unforseen presents. So that you may book out for us on Saturday the 17th the day of Burgoyns surrender, and the succeeding onto my birth day. Have a Light on the wharf. I hope we shall be in time for a Dance.

Inclosed is a note of thanks from the General for his preserves. The Cover[?] Store off to render it more susceptible of inclosure. 

I sent some Lemons by M. Schell, and the other Articles by the Paragon. 

Tell Maturin if Tasso[?] is not well broke so send him to Doctor Nichol who resides with George B. Everteon[?] at Poughkupsie who will put him in Order, provided he has him soon. 

God bless you all, prays your aff.
