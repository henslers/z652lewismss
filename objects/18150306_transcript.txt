Troy 6th March 15.

My dear Gitty

The Court martial has adjourned to the 13th_ The badness of the roads has deterred me from taking advantage of the reccess to pay a visit to Staatsburg. The Ice at this place broke up last night and th Boats are plying across this morning- I presume the Steam boats will be in operation in a few days- I have however determined not to quit until we have finished our business_ Tobias neglected telling me where he left the Store room key_ I long to hear how you got home. I fear you have had difficulty. 

My love to the Children.

your ever affectionate

ML.
