Grenadier Island 25th Octo: 13

My dear Love,

I arrived at this point on Thursday. Misfortunes still persecute us. The troops embarked from the Harbor on Saturday preceeding- the distance only 18 Miles, and that too along shore; a Storm which arose in the share of five Minutes, without previous notice, dispersed them and wrecked them in all possible situations. They have suffered much and are not-yet-all collected. God knows when we shall set out from here. If we do not in a few days, we may as well abandon our expedition, for the winter will in a few days set in here. 

Wilkinson continues sick, and I have been unwell with my old complaint but am getting better. 

God in his infinite mercy preserve + protect you all.

your aff. Hus.d 

ML
