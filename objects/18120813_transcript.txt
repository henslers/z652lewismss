Albany 13th August 1812

I arrived here my dearest friend at six this morning, after passing, contrary to my expectation, an agreeable night. The Cap.t gave me M. Cutting’s Birth, which was the best in the Cabin, at least the one I like best.

Genl. Provost sent last week his Adj. General to Genl. Dearborn, with an official Account of the qualified repeal of the British Orders in Council, accompanied with a proposition for our Armistice, which has been acceeded to ‘till the pleasure of the President be known. 

How think you the business is here rec.d? The feds + Clintonians are mortified at it and cannot conceal their chagrin. But what most surprises me is, that they now declare they are opposed to every thing like an accomodation on the subject of Seamen and declare that the Eastern States cannot carry on their Commerce without the Aid of British Seamen.

___ My best respects to all our friends at Mrs. Clermont. I sincerely wish I was with you. 

your Aff.

ML.
