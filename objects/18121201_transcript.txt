Burlington 1. Decem. 1[the rest is torn off but should say 1812]

I have been detained here my dearest friend much longer than I expected or than either of us wishes. But the unexpected arrangment of the Troops for winter quarters and the security of the publis shores, rendered it necessary for me to remain until I could have every thing properly disposed of. The Troops here suffered much, from lyin out in very severe weather. We have them now tolerably well covered. I shall hope to see you by Monday or Tuesday next. 

your aff.
