Buffalo 22.d April 1813

My dearest love

I have written you from almost every stage of my journey, where I have found a post-office, and twice from this place; but have not rec.d a line from any of the family since I left you.

I have twice reconnoitered[?] the Enemyâ€™s posts on the opposite side of the River; where they are industriously at work erecting defenses which we shall never disturb them in. If our plans succeed, of which I have no doubt, they must surrender these works or starve in them.

We had very unfavorable weather last night for our military ball. An incessant rain of 24 Hours. Notwithstand which 23 Ladies attended- and I assure you would not have disgraced an Albany assembly.

Desire Maturin to file the inclosed receipt with my public Vouchers and to acknowledge its safe arrival. 

God bless + preserve you and Ours

your Affc Husband
