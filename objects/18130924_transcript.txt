Sackett’s Harbor 24th Sep. 1813

I arrived here my dearest friend yesterday at noon having experienced no other Accident than breaking the Axlehee[? Axwheel?] of my waggon[sic] which delayed my Journey half a day. I was favored with the most delightful weather; neither too hot nor too cold. The roads in as good Order as new roads can be expected to be, free from dust and mud. The only exception to the weather was half an hour’s rain yesterday morning. I am in perfect health and find every Body pleased with my return.

Wilkinson has been ill at Fort George but has recovered. Our Army here is in good health and fine Spirits, and I think if led ag. the Enemy will give a good account of them. God bless you my dearest Life and grant us once more a happy meeting. 

your aff.
