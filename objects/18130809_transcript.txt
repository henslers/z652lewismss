Sackett’s Harbor 9th Aug.t 1813

My dearest friend,

We are all lying here on our Oars watching the arrival of the Secretary of War when it is presumed we shall know what is to be the future Course of the Campaign. Our fleet had been out now for nineteen days. It went up to the head of the Lake where it remains cruising. At York it landed a party and destroyed some public stores. The Lady of the Lake arrived here yesterday morning from the fleet and departed again in the vening with a reinforcement of mariens and Seamen. The Cap.t informed us that yesterday our Army attempted a general Attack on the Enemy, and that many of our Savages had joined us, and would be in the action. The British fleet put to Sea a few days after our’s,[sic] cruised about at this End of the Lake for Some days and went into port again without going in quest of Chaundry notwithstanding they mount nineteen Guns more than he does and of heavier metal. Our advantage is in having long Guns and braver men; and I think if they dare fight they will be beaten. 

Our health here is improving; owing to the introduction of a strict police, which has removed the filth, (which certainly caused the sickness,) and prevented the further accumulation of it. You can form no conception of the abominable nuisance which everywhere assailed us on my first arrival. It was difficult to breath[sic], and you could literally taste the putridity of the Atmosphere; had the weather been warm pestilence would have been inevitable. We have now a pure Atmosphere; have taught our men to be cleanly, and have few, if any new Cases of Disease.

I have procured some flannel + will make my shirts answe for the present. 

Remember me most affectionately to our dear Children. Kiss them for me again + again- God be with you all

Your Aff.

ML.
