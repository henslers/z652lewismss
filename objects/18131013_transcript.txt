Sackettsâ€™ Harbor 13th Octo. 1813

My dearest friend

Contrary to our wishes and Expectations here we are still, delayed by the most unrelenting Storm I ever witnessed. A few miles back of us, we are told, the Snow is 14 inches deep; though I presume we must allow a little for exageration[sic]. Our Troops who left Fort George the 27th of Sep. have not yet arrived, though the distance is frequently run in 30 hours and has been performed in 14. This is a great drawback on our Operations, and I fear will curtail them to the great dissatisfaction of the Country, who look for naught but Success, and expect their Armies + Navies must control even the Elements.

Wilkinson is very unwell, and has been so for a long time. I thank God I am in perfect health though I have been a little annoyed by bile till I got rid of it. I have rec.d your Letters of the 27th [????] + 3.d Ins.t Why is it that when you write to me you never say anything of the state of Things at home which you must suppose I should like to know something of. The State of the Buildings, Farm factory, mills +c. though of the latter I presume you know not much. Give me what little nowledge you have, for a little is better than none. Has Maturin been to Delaware? I presume he has not. 

My Love to our Children. God bless you all

your aff. Hus.d
