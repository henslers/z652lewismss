Albany 10th Decem. 1812

I arrived here, my dearest friend, yesterday to dinner, in company with Gen. Dearborn and Suite. I need not say, how much I was disappointed, on entering M. Ludlow’s house, to find you had departed. The cause was an afflicting one; and produced sensations which, the exertion of all my philosophy could not bear me up against- I was completely unmanned; and do not believe I could at that moment have looked a british army in the face. I found two Letters from you, dated at Clermont, which allayed the pleasure I desired from hearing you were in health, by presenting to my mind the eloquent Ejaculations of the Psalm ist[?] “Lord what is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him.” What a change! Who, who could command his fate, would not sufer[sic] a glorious death in his country’s Cause? 

I wrote you twice from Burlington and directed my Letters to the care of M. Ludlow, but understand from him that they were not not[Lewis added the extra “not” as he flipped the page over] sent to him- I presume therefore that the Post Master forwarded them to you____

My Absense from this peace has produced an accumulation of buyings which will require some days to get through with. As soon as I can dispose of it, I shall endeavor to obtain leave to join you, for a little time at Staatsberg[?]- God bless you and our house, most fervently prays

your ever Aff. Husband
