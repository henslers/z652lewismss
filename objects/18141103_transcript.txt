Washington the 3d. Novem. 14.

My dear Love, 

Lynih has written to his wife from almost every Stage, ad as he has communicated every thing related to my Affairs I presume you have not wanted information. He is an excellent young man, and must be admired by all who know his worth__ I have born the fatigue of our Journey beyond asperation[?], and reached this City yesterday at noon without Accident or Indisposition. I have this day had a long Interview with the Prest: I rec.d strong professions of personal regard, but informed that the successes of our younger Generals had produced on the public Sentiments, as the Pres. believed, a biass[sic] in favor of employing none else, not to be resisted, though not subscribed to by the Administration. In fine I was referred to Munroe[sic], and shall wait on him tomorrow. I have taken high ground and shall not quit it. 

Yourâ€™s most affectionately

ML.
