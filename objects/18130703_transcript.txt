Sackettsâ€™ Harbor 3.d July 1813

I arrived here my dear and affectionate friend yesterday about noon, and should have immediately advised you of it, could I have procured a place where I could seat myself to write. The quarters which had been intended for me were occupied as a hospital for the wounded and the late Action; and of course required cleaning before I could enter them. I am now in them, but by no means as comfortably situated as at Niagara. though this place has, in one respect, and important advantage over the other. The Camp is better supplied with small meats from the Country- of course we live better here than there.

The British a few nights since conceived and partly executed a plan for surprising our Ships in the Night. The dispositions making indicated that we had discovered their their Designs, and some of their good friends immediately gave them intelligence to that effect when they hastily retreated from the position they had taken within three or four miles of us. Had the attempt been made they certainly would have paid the Piper.

I fear this will not reach you till[sic] you leave Albany- should that be the case you will receive it at home when you may say to all our dear children G. Papa is well and sends them much love and many kisses.

God bless you all in the prayer of     your aff. Husband
