Albany 1st Sep. 1812

My dear Love

I thank you for your affectionate Letter and I hope although you are not fond of scribbling, you will not forget that immersed as I am in business, charged with the management of every department, from the want of a clue organization of every one but my own, the only pleasure I have is to hear that those whom most I love are at ease and happy. A single Line therefore informing me of the welfare of my family, will always be to me the most grateful and acceptable gift.

We do not yet know the true Causes of Hullâ€™s disaster. Much we have reason to believe is ascribable to disease; as we are informed that as far back as the 29th of last month he had but 800 men fit for duty. I fear however that the head of the War Department will not escape censure. Many of the Federalists cannot disguise their exultation though they pretend to be much mortified. I am happy to find that it has produced no dismay either in the Army, or in the Country at large; on the contrary, it has evidently had the effect of exciting a spirit of Vengeance; and a desire to efface the Pain.

Has Maturin got the steel reeds? If so, let him start the large Loom for fine flannels. John is manufacturing nothing else, but fine + coarse goods of that description. 

Let my flannel drawers and woolen Stockings be just in order, I shall soon want them. 

Let Smith have his ten dollars, and discharge the Ditchers as soon as you can. 

I send you twenty dollars, all I can at present spare.

Kiss all our dear Children for me, and give them my blessing. 

I cannot say when I shall be with you It will be some time first. 

your affectionate 

ML
