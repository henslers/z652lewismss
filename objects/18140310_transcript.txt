Albany 10th March 1814

You must not my dear Gitty imagine yourself neglected, if you do not receive Letters from me as frequently as you wish. You must naturally suppose my time much occupied, unless you can believe that I do not perform my duty_ I presume whenever I have written to Maturin he has informed you of it, and he assured you if I was unwell you would not be long ignorant of it.

The reports respecting Wilkinson are various_ I do not believe he has been arrested, but I presume he either has been, or will be removed from the command of the Army. Perhaps much in the same manner that Dearborn was. 

We have a story that Harrison has attacked and captured a considable[sic] british force which had reoccupied Malden. It comes from Kingston after Canada to Sacketts Harbour, so that it may be true. 

I know not how I am to be disposed of the ensuing summer_ I will find the Books Julia wishes by Peter if I can procure them. He made a grand speech last night at a public meeting, and acquired much reputation. The Garden fence must stand till I return. It is a very expensive thing and therefore must be done, if at all, economically. Our expenses are already very heavy. 

Let your Gardner[sic] procure a number of pipping[?] Grafts- now is the time for cutting them, but it must not be delayed a day. The Tree which stands by the road side just within Ackerts Fence, on the farm which was old Schnoers, is a very good one. I want none but Pippins. He may cut a few Lady Apples if he pleases.

God bless you all                your aff. husband
