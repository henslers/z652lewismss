Burlington 26th Nov. 1812

My dearest friend,

Our Army crossed the British lines on Thursday last, at least a considerable Detachment of them, the remainder lying on their arms ready to act according to circumstances. They drove in the Enemyâ€™s advanced Picket Guard and burnt their guard House. Few lives were lost, on our part 6 wounded, one of whon died- the Enemy lost about an equal number killed. Their whole body immediately retreated, destroying the Country as they went- burning their Mills of every description, forage, Barns, and in some instances the dwellings of those of their subjects whom they suspected of disaffection finding they were not displaced to fight us, and knowing we could not follow them to the other side of the S. Lawrence our tropps returned, and are now going into winter quarters. Gen. Dearborn is expected here tomorrow, when I shall be enabled to determine whether it will be necessary for me to remain longer in this Quarter or not. I rather think I shall return with him. I have been perfectly well. 

God bless you

your affc
