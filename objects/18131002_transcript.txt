Sackett’s harbor 2.d Octo. 13.

It is 17 days my dearest Love since I left me home and in all that time I have never heard from it directly or indirectly. I am at a loss to tell to what this has been owing.

48 hours will probaby complete my sojournment at this place. Wilkinson is on the way with the bulk of the Army of Fort George- As soon as he reaches us we shall be off to seek the foe in the Regions of the North. Our force will be very respectable, and I think sufficient for the Object. When next you write to me, direct your Letter to Burlington Vermont, thence to be forwarded; as I think we shall be in poss.n of Montreal in a fortnight.

Sir George has become very civil since Perry’s glorious victory. He returned us six Soldiers the other day without exchange; On the ground of their having been shipwrecked on the british Shore, and his disinclination to add to their Misfortunes. This is very different from his former Conduct. He has gone to Montreal. 

My Love to our Children + their Children- God preserve you all.

your Aff. Hus-d

ML.
