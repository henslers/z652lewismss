Your letter of the 20th reached me my best and dearest friend By the mail of this morning since last I wrote you we have commenced with the general w's trial it's trial so that my prospects of a speedy return to my family have vanished. We commenced on the 31st with the examination of general swarthwout with whom we have been engaged for 3 days and are still apparently far from a close. He refuted the charge of intoxication, which it was said he would prove. He however appears hostile to W.

The weather has been with us as intensely cold as with you. Everything in my bedroom froze, and I have been obliged to wrap my head in my flannel gown to preserve my nose and ears for a similar fate. I am however in every other respect comfortably situated it's comfortably situated in an amiable and respectable family of good republicans, where cleanliness, good humor, More gentility than is usual in a country village, the village, and the most accommodating disposition prevails. I have been truly fortunate. I am glad to hear you have returned to your old room; it is a more comfortable einter bedchamber than the other.

Tell Casar to take advantage of this snow to break the mare mules. He must be cautious not to overload them, and to place a horse by the side of each in the 1st instance.

I fear for the fate of N. Orleans. We were 3 days ago amused with a story of our complete success - since which are accounts are rather unfavorable. They're unfavorable. God grant success to our Arms in that quarter and Glory and Safety to your Brother and Nephew.

My love to Margaret Maturin + the Children 

your ever affectionate friend and husband
