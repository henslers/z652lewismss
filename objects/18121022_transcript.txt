Albany 22 Octo. 1812

My dear Love

I arrived here last Evening at eleven OClock. Dearborn missed the Steamboat at Hudson; which he did not regret, as he says he had a very pleasant ride and reached his Quarters by monday noon. Stephen has arrived safe.

The inclosed will give you the particulars, as far as we possess them, of the imprudent, though gallant Affair at Lewiston. Your friend Solomon, received a wound immediately on landing, through the Thigh. He advanced however with the Troops, received a second through the Hip, he still advanced, received a third through the calf of the oppostie Leg, went on notwithstanding, till[sic] he received a violent contusion in th heel, supposed from a Cannon shot, which brought him to the Ground, and disabled him. He was carried off, and thus saved from being a Prisoner. He is however doing well, as you may believe when I tell you he has sent for a new pair of Boots.

Henry Armstrong, Colo.l.s Christie and Fenwick are slightly wounded and prisoners. Colo.l.s. Stranaghan + Bloom of the militia are also wounded, (the former severely) and are prisoners. Cap.n.s Gibson of the eight Artillery, Neilson of the 6th Infantry, and Lieu.t Morris of the light Artillery (brother of the first Lieu.t who was wounded on board the Constitution) were killed. Our Loss is not ascertained, but believed to be about 400. 

The works on the heights of Queenstown were taken by Apault[?]; retaken by the British, again apaulted and carried by our Troops, and the possession maintained for near three Hours; when they marched out and gave Battle to Brock on the plain at the head of five times their members. Thus you see, we have acquired Glory though at a dear rate. The British have asked a three day suspension of Hostilities; which has been granted. Genl. Van Rensselaer[?], in consequences of the height of party Spirit in his Camp, has asked leave to retire.

Yourâ€™s Affy.
